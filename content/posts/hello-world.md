Hey! This is the first post of my personal blog. Here I will try to write about insights/challenges that I faced while working as a SRE, and about any other cool stuff that may come through my mind. I think it will be a good way for me to share experiences, as well improve my technical writing skills. Welcome and enjoy the ride!
