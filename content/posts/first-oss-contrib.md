#Why it took me so long?
Ever since I started working as an IT professional, I never thought that contributing to open source was for me. It always seemed that it was reserved only for god-like developers, that work at high-end companies and have lots of free time. When thinking about OSS, the image of Linus Torvalds always came through my mind. The man behind the LINUX, the biggest OSS of all time, and the man that gave a middle finger to NVIDIA.

Probably, this point-of-view was built over a series of factors. My first job was at a big investiment bank, so OSS was at the majority of times looked down upon. Lots of big traditional companies seem to prefer paying for life-long support, which for me  always looked like a disguise for the need of always having someone to call (and put the blame on) in case things go south. Also, there's probably a bit of the imposter syndrom. I just never felt confident enough about participating.

#Finding the right project (or maybe, like in soviet russia, the project finds you?)
